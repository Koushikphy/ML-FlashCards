### Handling Imbalance

---

1. **Resampling Techniques**:

   - Oversampling: Duplicate or synthesize samples for the minority class (e.g., SMOTE).
   - Undersampling: Remove samples from the majority class.
   - Class Weights: Assign higher weights to the minority class during model training to reduce bias.

2. **Generate Synthetic Data**: Use advanced techniques like GANs to create realistic samples for the minority class.

3. **Change Decision Threshold**: Adjust the classification threshold to favor the minority class.

4. **Use Specialized Models**: Use algorithms like XGBoost or Random Forest, which handle class imbalance well.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Focus on metrics like F1-score, Precision-Recall curve, or ROC-AUC instead of accuracy.

Choose strategies based on the dataset size, class distribution, and problem context.
