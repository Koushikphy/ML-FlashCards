### Curse of dimensionality

---


The curse of dimensionality refers to challenges that arise when working with high-dimensional data:

- **Sparsity**: As dimensions increase, data points become sparse, making it hard for algorithms to find patterns or clusters.

- **Increased** Complexity: More dimensions require exponentially more data to achieve the same density or statistical significance.

- **Overfitting**: Models can overfit high-dimensional data because they might capture noise instead of meaningful patterns.

- **Distance Metrics Break Down**: In high dimensions, distances between points become less meaningful as they converge to similar values.

**Solution**: Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) or feature selection to focus on the most relevant dimensions.
