### Bagging and Boosting


---


Both bagging and boosting are ensemble methods in machine learning that combine multiple models to improve overall performance. However, they work in fundamentally different ways.



### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

1. **How it Works**:  
   - **Data Resampling**: Multiple subsets of the dataset are created by sampling with replacement (bootstrap sampling).  
   - **Model Training**: A separate model (usually of the same type, like decision trees) is trained on each subset.  
   - **Aggregation**: The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of all models, typically through averaging (for regression) or majority voting (for classification).

2. **Key Features**:  
   - Models are trained **independently**.  
   - Reduces **variance** by averaging predictions.  
   - Best suited for high-variance, low-bias models (e.g., decision trees).

3. **Example Algorithm**:  
   Random Forest is a popular bagging-based algorithm where multiple decision trees are trained on bootstrapped datasets, and each tree considers a random subset of features for splits.

### Boosting


1. **How it Works**:  
   - **Sequential Learning**: Models are trained one after another, and each new model corrects the errors of its predecessor.  
   - **Weighted Updates**: More emphasis is placed on the samples that were misclassified or poorly predicted by earlier models.  
   - **Final Prediction**: A weighted combination of all models' outputs is used to make the final prediction.

2. **Key Features**:  
   - Models are trained **sequentially**.  
   - Reduces both **bias** and **variance**.  
   - Typically uses weak learners (e.g., shallow decision trees) and builds a strong learner by combining them.

3. **Example Algorithms**:  
   - **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)**: Assigns higher weights to misclassified samples, forcing subsequent models to focus on these harder cases.  
   - **Gradient Boosting**: Optimizes the model by minimizing a loss function using gradient descent. Popular implementations include XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
