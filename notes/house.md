One project I’ve worked on is the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** competition from Kaggle. It’s a classic supervised regression problem where the goal is to predict the sale prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using various features. I’ll walk you through it step-by-step—from problem understanding to model evaluation.

---

### **1. Problem Understanding & Objective**

* **Goal**: Predict the final sale price of homes given 79 explanatory variables like location, quality, size, and condition.
* **Nature**: It’s a **regression problem**, with the **target variable** being `SalePrice` (a continuous variable).

---

### **2. Data Exploration (EDA)**

* **Initial Checks**:

  * Shape of the data (`train.shape`)
  * Data types of features (`object`, `int`, `float`)
  * Summary statistics (`df.describe()`)

* **Missing Values**:

  * Found many features with missing data (e.g., `PoolQC`, `Alley`, `FireplaceQu`, etc.)
  * Applied **domain reasoning**: if `GarageType` is NA, it likely means **no garage** rather than missing value.

* **Target Variable (`SalePrice`)**:

  * Skewed to the right, so I applied a **log transformation**: `np.log1p(SalePrice)` to stabilize variance and improve model performance.

* **Feature-Target Relationships**:

  * Used scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.
  * `GrLivArea`, `OverallQual`, `TotalBsmtSF` showed strong positive correlation with `SalePrice`.

---

### **3. Feature Engineering**

* **Creating New Features**:

  * Created `TotalSF` = `TotalBsmtSF` + `1stFlrSF` + `2ndFlrSF` to better capture the home size.
  * Added interaction features like `TotalBath` = FullBath + 0.5 \* HalfBath

* **Handling Categorical Variables**:

  * Applied **Label Encoding** for ordinal categories (like `ExterQual`, `BsmtQual`)
  * Used **One-Hot Encoding** for nominal variables (`Neighborhood`, `GarageType`, etc.)

* **Skewness Correction**:

  * Identified skewed numeric features (`skew() > 0.75`) and applied `Box-Cox` or `log1p` to normalize.

* **Multicollinearity Check**:

  * Checked `VIF` and correlation matrix. Removed highly collinear variables to reduce redundancy (e.g., kept `GrLivArea`, dropped `2ndFlrSF` if they were highly correlated).

---

### **4. Data Imputation and Scaling**

* For missing values:

  * **Numerical**: used `median` imputation.
  * **Categorical**: used `mode` or custom logic (e.g., filling `NA` with “None” where it implied absence of a feature)

* **Feature Scaling**:

  * Used `StandardScaler` to normalize features for models like Lasso and Ridge which are sensitive to feature scale.

---

### **5. Model Selection & Training**

I experimented with multiple models:

* **Linear Models**: Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet

  * Used **cross-validation** with `GridSearchCV` to tune hyperparameters (`alpha`, `l1_ratio`)
  * Lasso helped with **feature selection** due to its regularization nature.

* **Tree-Based Models**:

  * **XGBoost**: Used early stopping with a validation set, tuned `max_depth`, `eta`, `subsample`, etc.
  * **LightGBM**: Faster training, similar results.
  * Used **log1p-transformed** target variable for better performance.

* **Blending and Stacking**:

  * Finally, I blended models:

    * Simple average of Lasso and XGBoost predictions
    * Also tried a stacking regressor: base models (Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM), meta-model (Linear Regression)

---

### **6. Evaluation**

* **Metric**: Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)

  * Applied inverse transform (`expm1`) on predictions to get back to original scale
  * Cross-validated RMSLE: around **0.11**, which is competitive

* **Error Analysis**:

  * Analyzed residuals: predicted vs actual
  * Found outliers: large houses sold at unusually low prices—either removed or down-weighted

---

### **7. Key Learnings**

* **Data preprocessing** is as important as model complexity.
* **Feature engineering** contributed more to performance than deep model tuning.
* Learned the importance of **model ensembling** and **bias-variance trade-off**.

---

### **8. Technologies Used**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
* XGBoost, LightGBM
* Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization
* Jupyter Notebook for EDA and development
