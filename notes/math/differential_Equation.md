## Solve $\frac{dy}{dt} + p(t)y = q(t)$ using integrating factors.

To solve the **first-order linear differential equation**

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} + p(t)y = q(t)
$$

using the **integrating factor** method, follow these steps:



### üîπ Step 1: Identify the integrating factor

The integrating factor is:

$$
\mu(t) = e^{\int p(t)\,dt}
$$



### üîπ Step 2: Multiply the entire differential equation by $\mu(t)$

Multiply both sides of the original equation:

$$
\mu(t) \frac{dy}{dt} + \mu(t)p(t)y = \mu(t)q(t)
$$

The left-hand side becomes the derivative of $\mu(t)y$, because:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y] = \mu(t)\frac{dy}{dt} + \mu'(t)y = \mu(t)\frac{dy}{dt} + \mu(t)p(t)y
$$

So the equation becomes:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y] = \mu(t)q(t)
$$



### üîπ Step 3: Integrate both sides

$$
\int \frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y]\,dt = \int \mu(t)q(t)\,dt
$$

This yields:

$$
\mu(t)y = \int \mu(t)q(t)\,dt + C
$$



### üîπ Step 4: Solve for $y(t)$

$$
y(t) = \frac{1}{\mu(t)}\left( \int \mu(t)q(t)\,dt + C \right)
$$



### ‚úÖ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{y(t) = \frac{1}{e^{\int p(t)\,dt}} \left( \int e^{\int p(t)\,dt} q(t)\,dt + C \right)}
$$

This is the general solution using the integrating factor method. Let me know if you'd like to apply this to a specific example.

## What are the stability criteria for a system of linear ODEs?


The **stability criteria** for a **system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** depend primarily on the **eigenvalues of the system matrix**.


### ‚úÖ System Form

Consider the system of linear ODEs:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = A\mathbf{x}
$$

where:

* $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is an $n$-dimensional vector,
* $A$ is an $n \times n$ constant matrix.

---

### üîç Stability Types

Stability refers to the behavior of solutions as $t \to \infty$, particularly near an equilibrium point (usually $\mathbf{x} = 0$).

### 1. **Asymptotic Stability (Stable Node/Spiral)**

The zero solution is **asymptotically stable** if:

* **All eigenvalues** of matrix $A$ have **negative real parts**.

‚úÖ The system decays to zero as $t \to \infty$.

---

### 2. **Marginal Stability (Center)**

The zero solution is **marginally stable** if:

* All eigenvalues have **non-positive real parts**,
* And **eigenvalues with zero real part are simple** (i.e., their **algebraic multiplicity = geometric multiplicity**).

‚ö†Ô∏è The system does not grow, but may **oscillate or stay bounded** without decaying.

---

### 3. **Instability**

The zero solution is **unstable** if:

* At least **one eigenvalue** of $A$ has a **positive real part**, or
* Any eigenvalue has zero real part **but is not semisimple** (i.e., the geometric multiplicity < algebraic multiplicity).

‚ùå The solution **grows unbounded** as $t \to \infty$.

---

## üí° Summary Table

| Condition on Eigenvalues of $A$             | Stability Type        |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| All Re(Œª) < 0                               | Asymptotically Stable |
| All Re(Œª) ‚â§ 0, simple zero eigenvalues      | Marginally Stable     |
| Any Re(Œª) > 0 or defective Œª with Re(Œª) = 0 | Unstable              |

## Describe phase plane analysis for nonlinear systems.

**Phase plane analysis** is a powerful graphical method used to study the qualitative behavior of **nonlinear** systems of two first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It provides insight into how solutions evolve over time without needing exact solutions.



### üîπ 1. **System Setup**

We consider a system of the form:

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x, y)
\end{cases}
$$

This defines a **vector field** in the 2D **phase plane** (also called the state space), where each point $(x, y)$ has an associated velocity vector $(f(x, y), g(x, y))$.



### üîπ 2. **Equilibrium (Critical) Points**

These are points where:

$$
f(x, y) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad g(x, y) = 0
$$

At these points, the system doesn't change in time ‚Äî they are candidates for **steady states**.



### üîπ 3. **Linearization Near Equilibrium Points**

To understand behavior near an equilibrium $(x_0, y_0)$, we **linearize** the system using the **Jacobian matrix**:

$$
J =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}_{(x_0, y_0)}
$$

Then we analyze the **linearized system**:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt} = J\mathbf{u}
\quad \text{where } \mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} x - x_0 \\ y - y_0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

The **type and stability** of the equilibrium is determined by the **eigenvalues of $J$**.



## üîπ 4. **Classification of Equilibria**

| Eigenvalues of $J$        | Type of Equilibrium     | Stability             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Real, distinct, same sign | Node (stable if < 0)    | Stable/Unstable       |
| Real, opposite signs      | Saddle point            | Unstable              |
| Complex with Re < 0       | Spiral (stable focus)   | Asymptotically stable |
| Complex with Re > 0       | Spiral (unstable focus) | Unstable              |
| Pure imaginary (Re = 0)   | Center                  | Neutrally stable      |



## üîπ 5. **Sketching the Phase Portrait**

To build the phase plane:

* Plot equilibrium points.
* Draw **nullclines**: curves where $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ or $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.
* Draw **direction fields** (vector arrows).
* Sketch **trajectories** showing how solutions evolve over time.
* Identify **limit cycles**, spirals, nodes, or separatrices (boundaries between behaviors).



## üîπ 6. **Nonlinear Behavior**

The linearized analysis is valid **only near equilibrium points**. For global behavior:

* Use numerical simulations or software (e.g., MATLAB, Python, PPLANE).
* Look for **limit cycles** (closed orbits not predicted by linearization).
* Use **Lyapunov functions** for global stability assessment (if applicable).



## üîö Summary

Phase plane analysis allows you to:

* Visualize dynamics of nonlinear systems.
* Classify equilibria and their stability.
* Understand long-term behavior without solving explicitly.

## Solve the heat equation using separation of variables.

To solve the **heat equation** using **separation of variables**, we follow a standard procedure. Let‚Äôs go through the method step-by-step for a 1D case.

---

## üîπ Problem Statement

Solve the 1D heat equation:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, \quad 0 < x < L,\ t > 0
$$

with boundary and initial conditions:

$$
u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0, \quad u(x, 0) = f(x)
$$

Here:

* $u(x, t)$ is the temperature at position $x$ and time $t$,
* $\alpha^2$ is the thermal diffusivity,
* $f(x)$ is the initial temperature distribution.

---

## üîπ Step 1: Separation of Variables

Assume a solution of the form:

$$
u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)
$$

Substitute into the PDE:

$$
X(x) \frac{dT}{dt} = \alpha^2 T(t) \frac{d^2X}{dx^2}
$$

Divide both sides by $\alpha^2 X(x) T(t)$:

$$
\frac{1}{\alpha^2 T(t)} \frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{1}{X(x)} \frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\lambda
$$

We set both sides equal to a **negative constant** $-\lambda$ (negative to satisfy boundary conditions later).

This yields two ODEs:

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \lambda X = 0 \\
\frac{dT}{dt} + \alpha^2 \lambda T = 0
\end{cases}
$$

---

## üîπ Step 2: Solve the Spatial Equation

$$
\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \lambda X = 0, \quad X(0) = X(L) = 0
$$

This is a **Sturm-Liouville problem**. Nontrivial solutions exist only for certain values of $\lambda$:

* Eigenvalues: $\lambda_n = \left( \frac{n\pi}{L} \right)^2$, for $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$
* Eigenfunctions: $X_n(x) = \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)$

---

## üîπ Step 3: Solve the Time Equation

$$
\frac{dT_n}{dt} + \alpha^2 \lambda_n T_n = 0 \Rightarrow T_n(t) = C_n e^{-\alpha^2 \lambda_n t}
$$

---

## üîπ Step 4: General Solution

Combine $X_n(x)$ and $T_n(t)$:

$$
u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n e^{-\alpha^2 \left( \frac{n\pi}{L} \right)^2 t} \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)
$$

---

## üîπ Step 5: Apply Initial Condition

Use $u(x, 0) = f(x)$ to determine coefficients $C_n$ via Fourier sine series:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} C_n \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)
$$

$$
C_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^L f(x) \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)\,dx
$$

---

## ‚úÖ Final Solution:

$$
\boxed{
u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{2}{L} \int_0^L f(s) \sin\left( \frac{n\pi s}{L} \right)\,ds \right) e^{-\alpha^2 \left( \frac{n\pi}{L} \right)^2 t} \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)
}
$$

## Derive the Black-Scholes PDE.


To **derive the Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation (PDE)**, we start with the assumptions of the model and apply **Ito‚Äôs Lemma** and **no-arbitrage principles**. The derivation leads to a PDE that governs the price of a European option (call or put).



## üîπ Step 1: Black-Scholes Model Assumptions

* The price $S(t)$ of the underlying asset follows a **geometric Brownian motion**:

$$
dS = \mu S\,dt + \sigma S\,dW_t
$$

  where:

  * $\mu$ = expected return,
  * $\sigma$ = volatility (constant),
  * $W_t$ = standard Brownian motion.

* Markets are frictionless: no arbitrage, no transaction costs, continuous trading.

* Constant risk-free rate $r$.

* The option price $V(S, t)$ is a function of $S$ and time $t$.

---

## üîπ Step 2: Apply Ito‚Äôs Lemma to $V(S, t)$

Since $V$ is a function of $S(t)$, and $S$ is stochastic, use **Ito‚Äôs Lemma** to write:

$$
dV = \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} dt + \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} dS + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} (dS)^2
$$

Substitute $dS = \mu S\,dt + \sigma S\,dW$ and $(dS)^2 = \sigma^2 S^2 dt$:

$$
dV = \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} \right) dt + \sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} dW
$$

---

## üîπ Step 3: Construct a Riskless Portfolio

Define a portfolio $\Pi$ consisting of:

* **Short one option**: value = $-V$
* **Long $\Delta$ shares** of the stock: value = $\Delta S$

So,

$$
\Pi = \Delta S - V
$$

The differential of the portfolio is:

$$
d\Pi = \Delta\,dS - dV
$$

Substitute in expressions for $dS$ and $dV$:

$$
d\Pi = \Delta (\mu S\,dt + \sigma S\,dW) - \left[ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} \right] dt - \sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} dW
$$

Group $dt$ and $dW$ terms:

$$
d\Pi = \left[ \Delta \mu S - \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} - \mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} \right] dt + \left[ \Delta \sigma S - \sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} \right] dW
$$

---

## üîπ Step 4: Eliminate Risk (Set Coefficient of $dW = 0$)

To make the portfolio riskless, set:

$$
\Delta = \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}
$$

Then:

$$
d\Pi = \left[ \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} \mu S - \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} - \mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} \right] dt = \left[ - \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} \right] dt
$$

---

## üîπ Step 5: No-Arbitrage Pricing

Since the portfolio is riskless, it must earn the **risk-free rate** $r$:

$$
d\Pi = r \Pi dt = r(\Delta S - V) dt = r \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} S - V \right) dt
$$

Equating with previous expression for $d\Pi$:

$$ - \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} = r \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} S - V \right) $$

Multiply both sides by $-1$:

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0
$$

---

## ‚úÖ Final Result: The Black-Scholes PDE

$$
\boxed{
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0
}
$$

This equation governs the price $V(S, t)$ of a **European option** under the Black-Scholes framework.

Let me know if you'd like to see the solution for a European call or put option using this PDE.

## What is the method of characteristics?

The **method of characteristics** is a powerful technique used to solve **first-order partial differential equations (PDEs)**. It transforms a PDE into a system of **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** along curves called **characteristics**, where the PDE becomes easier to solve.

---

## üîπ Applicable To:

**First-order PDEs**, typically of the form:

$$
a(x, y, u)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + b(x, y, u)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = c(x, y, u)
$$

where $u = u(x, y)$ is the unknown function.

---

## üîπ Key Idea:

Find **curves** (called **characteristics**) in the $(x, y)$ plane along which the PDE reduces to an **ODE**. The solution $u(x, y)$ is then constant or evolves predictably along these curves.

---

## üîπ Step-by-Step Procedure:

Given the PDE:

$$
a(x, y, u)u_x + b(x, y, u)u_y = c(x, y, u)
$$

Define the **characteristic equations**:

$$
\frac{dx}{ds} = a(x, y, u), \quad \frac{dy}{ds} = b(x, y, u), \quad \frac{du}{ds} = c(x, y, u)
$$

These are **ODEs** in the parameter $s$, which traces out the characteristic curves.

---

## üîπ Solve in 3 Steps:

1. **Solve the characteristic ODEs** to find:

$$
x(s), \quad y(s), \quad u(s)
$$
2. **Eliminate $s$** to express $u$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.
3. Apply **initial or boundary conditions** to find the specific solution.

---

## üîπ Example: Linear Transport Equation

Solve:

$$
u_x + u_y = 0, \quad u(x, 0) = f(x)
$$

**Characteristic equations**:

$$
\frac{dx}{ds} = 1, \quad \frac{dy}{ds} = 1, \quad \frac{du}{ds} = 0
$$

Solve:

* $x = s + x_0$
* $y = s + y_0$
* $u = \text{const} \Rightarrow u = f(x_0)$

From $x - s = x_0$ and $y - s = y_0$, eliminate $s$:

$$
x - y = x_0 - y_0 = \text{const}
$$

Thus:

$$
u(x, y) = f(x - y)
$$

‚úÖ This is the general solution.

---

## üîö Summary:

The **method of characteristics**:

* Converts a PDE into a system of ODEs along characteristic curves.
* Is primarily used for **first-order nonlinear or linear PDEs**.
* Helps find **explicit or implicit solutions** when direct methods fail.

## Compare Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Runge-Kutta methods.

Here‚Äôs a detailed comparison of **Forward Euler**, **Backward Euler**, and **Runge-Kutta methods** for solving **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** numerically.

---

## üîπ Problem Setup

We consider an initial value problem (IVP):

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$

The goal is to approximate $y(t)$ at discrete time steps $t_n = t_0 + nh$ for a step size $h$.

---

## üî∏ 1. Forward Euler Method (Explicit Euler)

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)
$$

* **Type**: Explicit
* **Order**: 1st order
* **Stability**: Conditionally stable
* **Accuracy**: Low
* **Pros**: Very simple to implement
* **Cons**: Requires very small time steps for stability in stiff problems

---

## üî∏ 2. Backward Euler Method (Implicit Euler)

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})
$$

* **Type**: Implicit
* **Order**: 1st order
* **Stability**: Unconditionally stable for linear problems (good for stiff equations)
* **Accuracy**: Same order as Forward Euler
* **Pros**: Stable for stiff problems
* **Cons**: Requires solving nonlinear equations at each step (e.g., Newton's method)

---

## üî∏ 3. Runge-Kutta Methods

A family of higher-order **explicit** or **implicit** methods. The most common is the **4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4)**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
k_1 &= f(t_n, y_n) \\
k_2 &= f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_1\right) \\
k_3 &= f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2}k_2\right) \\
k_4 &= f\left(t_n + h, y_n + h k_3\right) \\
y_{n+1} &= y_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\end{aligned}
$$

* **Type**: Explicit
* **Order**: 4th order
* **Stability**: More stable than Euler for moderate $h$, but still not great for stiff problems
* **Accuracy**: High
* **Pros**: Good accuracy per step, widely used
* **Cons**: More computation per step; still not ideal for stiff equations

| Method         | Type     | Order | Stability              | Best For                   | Requires Solving Nonlinear Eq? |

---

## üî∏ Stiffness Consideration

* **Stiff equations**: Require implicit methods (e.g., Backward Euler or implicit Runge-Kutta).
* **Non-stiff equations**: RK4 is often preferred for its accuracy and simplicity.

## Discuss discretization error and stability of numerical schemes.


### üî∑ Discretization Error and Stability of Numerical Schemes

When solving differential equations numerically (especially PDEs and ODEs), **discretization error** and **stability** are two fundamental concepts that determine the accuracy and reliability of the solution.

---

## üîπ 1. Discretization Error

**Discretization error** arises when continuous equations are approximated by discrete counterparts (using finite differences, finite elements, etc.).

### ‚úÖ Definition:

> The **discretization error** is the difference between the exact solution of the differential equation and the exact solution of the **discrete numerical scheme**.

Formally, if:

* $u(t)$ is the true solution to the differential equation,
* $u_h(t)$ is the numerical solution (with step size $h$),

then:

$$
\text{Discretization Error} = u(t) - u_h(t)
$$

### üî∏ Types:

* **Local truncation error (LTE):** Error made in a **single step**.
* **Global error:** Accumulated error over all steps.

### üî∏ Order of Accuracy:

A method is said to be of **order $p$** if:

$$
\text{LTE} = \mathcal{O}(h^{p+1}), \quad \text{Global error} = \mathcal{O}(h^p)
$$

For example:

* Forward Euler: 1st order
* Runge-Kutta (RK4): 4th order

---

## üîπ 2. Stability

**Stability** concerns how numerical errors (from round-off, truncation, etc.) behave as the computation proceeds.

### ‚úÖ Definition:

> A numerical scheme is **stable** if errors do **not grow uncontrollably** during the computation.

Stability is especially critical for **long time simulations** and **stiff problems**.

---

### üî∏ Stability in ODEs

For the test equation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = \lambda y, \quad y(0) = y_0
$$

* For **Forward Euler**:

$$
y_{n+1} = (1 + h\lambda) y_n
$$

  The scheme is stable if $|1 + h\lambda| \leq 1$

* For **Backward Euler**:

$$
y_{n+1} = \frac{y_n}{1 - h\lambda}
$$

  Always stable for $\text{Re}(\lambda) < 0$ ‚Üí **A-stable**

---

### üî∏ Stability in PDEs

For PDEs like the heat equation, a common test is the **Von Neumann stability analysis**, which examines the growth of Fourier modes in the numerical solution.

* For the **explicit method** for the heat equation:

$$
u_j^{n+1} = u_j^n + \frac{\alpha \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} (u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n)
$$

Stability requires:

$$
\frac{\alpha \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \leq \frac{1}{2}
$$

This is a **conditional stability** condition.

* **Implicit methods** (e.g., backward Euler or Crank-Nicolson) are usually **unconditionally stable**.

---

## üîπ Relationship Between Consistency, Stability, and Convergence

The **Lax Equivalence Theorem** (for linear problems) states:

> If a finite difference scheme is **consistent** and **stable**, then it is **convergent**.

Where:

* **Consistency**: Discretized equations approximate the continuous ones.
* **Stability**: Numerical errors remain bounded.
* **Convergence**: Numerical solution tends to the true solution as $h \to 0$.

## How do finite difference and finite element methods differ?

Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Finite Element Method (FEM) are two major numerical techniques for solving differential equations, particularly partial differential equations (PDEs). Here's a detailed comparison of their **key differences**, **strengths**, and **applications**:

---

## üîπ 1. **Core Idea**

### ‚úÖ **Finite Difference Method (FDM):**

* Approximates derivatives using **difference formulas** at grid points.
* Operates directly on the **strong form** of the differential equation.

> Example:

$$
\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} \approx \frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}
$$

### ‚úÖ **Finite Element Method (FEM):**

* Approximates the solution by projecting onto a space of **piecewise polynomial basis functions**.
* Based on the **weak (variational) form** of the PDE.

> Example:
> Seeks $u \in V$ such that:

$$
\int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \, dx = \int_{\Omega} f v \, dx \quad \forall v \in V
$$

## How does the **heat equation** relate to Brownian motion?

The **heat equation** and **Brownian motion** are deeply connected through both **mathematics** and **physics**, particularly in the fields of probability theory, partial differential equations (PDEs), and statistical mechanics.

---

### üî• Heat Equation

The one-dimensional heat equation is:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

* $u(x, t)$: temperature (or probability density) at position $x$ and time $t$
* $D$: thermal diffusivity (in physics) or diffusion coefficient (in probability theory)

---

### üßä Brownian Motion

**Brownian motion** (or a **Wiener process**) is a random process $B_t$ with properties:

* $B_0 = 0$
* Independent increments
* Increments $B_{t+s} - B_s \sim \mathcal{N}(0, t)$
* Continuous paths

---

## üß† How Are They Related?

### 1. **Probability Density Function of Brownian Motion Solves the Heat Equation**

Let $p(x, t)$ be the probability density function of a particle undergoing Brownian motion. Then:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2}
$$

So **the heat equation describes how the probability distribution of Brownian motion evolves over time**.

---

### 2. **Fundamental Solution Connection**

If a Brownian particle starts at $x = 0$, its position at time $t$ is normally distributed with:

$$
p(x, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi D t}} \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\right)
$$

This function is also the **fundamental solution (Green's function)** to the heat equation with initial condition $u(x, 0) = \delta(x)$ (a point source of heat).

---

### 3. **Feynman‚ÄìKac Formula**

This is a powerful result linking **stochastic processes** (like Brownian motion) with **PDEs** (like the heat equation). It states:

> The solution to certain PDEs can be expressed as an expected value over a stochastic process (Brownian motion).

For example, the solution $u(x, t)$ to the heat equation with initial condition $u(x, 0) = f(x)$ is:

$$
u(x, t) = \mathbb{E}[f(x + \sqrt{2D} B_t)]
$$

This tells us the heat equation‚Äôs solution at $(x,t)$ is the expected value of the initial data evaluated at the position of a Brownian particle at time $t$.

## What is the difference between **ordinary and partial differential equations**?

The main difference between **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** and **partial differential equations (PDEs)** lies in the number of **independent variables** involved and the type of **derivatives** used.

---

### üßÆ 1. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

* Involve **derivatives with respect to a single independent variable**.
* The unknown function depends on **one variable** (typically time $t$).
* Use **ordinary derivatives** (like $\frac{dy}{dt}$).

#### üìå Example:

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = ky
$$

* Unknown: $y(t)$
* One independent variable: $t$

---

### üåê 2. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

* Involve **derivatives with respect to multiple independent variables**.
* The unknown function depends on **two or more variables** (like time and space).
* Use **partial derivatives** (like $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$).

#### üìå Example:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

* Unknown: $u(x, t)$
* Two independent variables: $x$ and $t$
