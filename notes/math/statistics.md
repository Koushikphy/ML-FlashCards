## What is the difference between independent and uncorrelated variables?


The concepts of **independent** and **uncorrelated** variables are related but **not equivalent**—and understanding the difference is crucial in statistics and probability theory.

---

### 🔹 Independent Variables

Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if knowing the value of one **gives no information** about the other. Formally:

$$
P(X \in A, Y \in B) = P(X \in A) \cdot P(Y \in B)
$$

for all sets $A$, $B$. This implies that their **joint distribution** is the product of their **marginal distributions**.

* **Stronger condition** than uncorrelatedness.
* If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, **they are always uncorrelated**.
* Independence implies **no statistical relationship at all**, not just linear.

---

### 🔹 Uncorrelated Variables

Two variables $X$ and $Y$ are **uncorrelated** if their **covariance is zero**:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \mathbb{E}[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)] = 0
$$

This means they have **no linear relationship**, but they might still be **non-linearly dependent**.

* Weaker condition than independence.
* Uncorrelated does **not** imply independence in general.
* For example, $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $Y = X^2$ are uncorrelated but clearly dependent (since knowing $X$ tells you $Y$).

---

### 🔍 When Does Uncorrelated = Independent?

If $X$ and $Y$ are **jointly normally distributed**, then:

$$
\text{Uncorrelated} \iff \text{Independent}
$$

This is a **special case** for multivariate normal distributions.

## Prove the Law of Total Probability and Bayes' Theorem.


Great question! Let's rigorously **prove the Law of Total Probability** and then **Bayes' Theorem**, using fundamental probability concepts.

---

## 🔹 1. **Law of Total Probability**

### 📘 Statement:

Let $\{B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n\}$ be a **partition** of the sample space $\Omega$ such that:

* $B_i \cap B_j = \emptyset$ for $i \ne j$ (mutually exclusive),
* $\bigcup_{i=1}^n B_i = \Omega$ (collectively exhaustive),
* $P(B_i) > 0$ for all $i$.

Then, for any event $A$:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i)
$$

---

### ✅ **Proof:**

We use the definition of conditional probability and the fact that the $B_i$'s form a partition.

#### Step 1: Express $A$ as a union:

Since the $B_i$'s partition $\Omega$, we can write $A$ as:

$$
A = A \cap \Omega = A \cap \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n B_i \right) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n (A \cap B_i)
$$

Because the $B_i$'s are disjoint, the sets $A \cap B_i$ are also disjoint. Therefore, by the **axioms of probability**:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A \cap B_i)
$$

#### Step 2: Use definition of conditional probability:

$$
P(A \cap B_i) = P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i)
$$

So:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i)
$$

✔️ **Law of Total Probability proven.**

---

## 🔹 2. **Bayes' Theorem**

### 📘 Statement:

Given the same partition $\{B_1, \dots, B_n\}$ of $\Omega$ with $P(B_i) > 0$, and given an event $A$ with $P(A) > 0$, then:

$$
P(B_j \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B_j) P(B_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^n P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i)}
$$

---

### ✅ **Proof:**

#### Step 1: Start with definition of conditional probability:

$$
P(B_j \mid A) = \frac{P(B_j \cap A)}{P(A)}
$$

#### Step 2: Apply the multiplication rule:

$$
P(B_j \cap A) = P(A \mid B_j) P(B_j)
$$

So:

$$
P(B_j \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B_j) P(B_j)}{P(A)}
$$

#### Step 3: Use **Law of Total Probability** to express $P(A)$:

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i)
$$

Hence:

$$
P(B_j \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B_j) P(B_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^n P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i)}
$$

✔️ **Bayes' Theorem proven.**

## What is the Central Limit Theorem? Why is it important?

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is one of the most important results in probability and statistics. It explains **why normal distributions are so common** and provides a powerful foundation for statistical inference.

---

## 🔹 Central Limit Theorem (CLT) — Statement

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a sequence of **i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed)** random variables with:

* Finite mean $\mu = \mathbb{E}[X_i]$
* Finite variance $\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(X_i)$

Then, as the sample size $n \to \infty$, the distribution of the **standardized sample mean** approaches a standard normal distribution:

$$
\frac{\bar{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

Where:

* $\bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$
* $\xrightarrow{d}$ means convergence in distribution

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

Even if the original data $X_i$ are **not normally distributed**, the average $\bar{X}_n$ will **approximately follow a normal distribution** as $n$ becomes large.

---

## ⭐ Why Is the CLT Important?

### 1. **Foundation for Inference**

* It justifies using **normal-based methods** (like z-tests and confidence intervals) even when the population distribution is unknown.
* Allows us to make probabilistic statements about **sample means**.

### 2. **Robustness**

* Applies to **many different distributions** (discrete or continuous) as long as they have finite mean and variance.
* This explains the prevalence of normal distributions in nature and science.

### 3. **Simplifies Complex Problems**

* Complicated sums of random variables become tractable.
* Forms the basis for approximations in hypothesis testing, quality control, polling, etc.

---

## 📌 Example

Suppose you roll a fair die (values 1–6), and compute the average result after many rolls. While the die outcomes are **uniform**, the **average result over many rolls** will tend toward a **normal distribution** by the CLT.



---

## Derive the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for a normal distribution.

Sure! Let's derive the **Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs)** for the **mean $\mu$** and **variance $\sigma^2$** of a normal distribution.

---

## 🔹 Problem Setup

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample from the normal distribution:

$$
X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2), \quad \text{i.i.d.}
$$

We want to find the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ that **maximize the likelihood** of the observed data.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Write the Likelihood Function

The probability density function (pdf) of a normal distribution is:

$$
f(x_i; \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$

So the **likelihood function** (joint pdf for i.i.d. data) is:

$$
L(\mu, \sigma^2) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i; \mu, \sigma^2) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \right)^n \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2 \right)
$$

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Take the Log-Likelihood

To simplify, take the **logarithm** of the likelihood:

$$
\ell(\mu, \sigma^2) = \log L(\mu, \sigma^2) = -\frac{n}{2} \log(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2} \log(\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2
$$

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Maximize with Respect to $\mu$

Take the partial derivative with respect to $\mu$:

$$
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \mu} = -\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)
$$

Set derivative to 0:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n\mu = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}
$$

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Maximize with Respect to $\sigma^2$

Take the partial derivative with respect to $\sigma^2$:

$$
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \sigma^2} = -\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{1}{2(\sigma^2)^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2
$$

Set to 0 and solve for $\sigma^2$:

$$
\frac{1}{2(\sigma^2)^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2 = \frac{n}{2\sigma^2}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2 = n\sigma^2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\boxed{\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \hat{\mu})^2}
$$

---

## ✅ Final MLEs for Normal Distribution:

* **Mean (MLE):** $\boxed{\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i}$
* **Variance (MLE):** $\boxed{\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum (x_i - \hat{\mu})^2}$

⚠️ Note: This differs from the **unbiased sample variance**, which uses $\frac{1}{n-1}$ instead of $\frac{1}{n}$.

## Explain hypothesis testing (Type I/II errors, p-values, power).


Hypothesis testing is a fundamental method in statistics used to make **data-driven decisions** or **inferences** about a population based on a sample.

---

## 🔹 1. **Hypothesis Testing Framework**

You start with two competing hypotheses:

* **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The default assumption (e.g., no effect, no difference)
* **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ):** The claim you want to test (e.g., there is an effect)

### Example:

* $H_0: \mu = 0$
* $H_1: \mu \ne 0$

---

## 🔹 2. **Types of Errors**

In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors you can make:

| Error Type        | What It Means                              | Symbol   | Consequence                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Type I Error**  | Rejecting $H_0$ when it is actually true   | $\alpha$ | **False positive** (overreacting)     |
| **Type II Error** | Failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true | $\beta$  | **False negative** (missed detection) |

> 🔸 $\alpha$ is the **significance level**, commonly set at 0.05
> 🔸 $\beta$ is the **probability of Type II error**

---

## 🔹 3. **p-Value**

The **p-value** is the **probability**, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result **as extreme or more extreme** than what you actually observed.

* If the p-value is **small** (typically < 0.05), it suggests the data is **inconsistent with $H_0$** → **reject $H_0$**
* If the p-value is **large**, the data is consistent with $H_0$

> 🔸 **Smaller p-value = stronger evidence against $H_0$**

---

## 🔹 4. **Power of a Test**

The **power** of a hypothesis test is the probability of **correctly rejecting $H_0$** when the alternative hypothesis is true.

$$
\text{Power} = 1 - \beta
$$

* High power means you're more likely to detect a true effect.
* Power increases with:

  * Larger sample size
  * Larger effect size
  * Lower variability
  * Higher significance level $\alpha$

---

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Concept  | Meaning                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $H_0$    | Null hypothesis                                               |
| $H_1$    | Alternative hypothesis                                        |
| $\alpha$ | Type I error rate (false positive)                            |
| $\beta$  | Type II error rate (false negative)                           |
| p-value  | Probability of observing data at least as extreme under $H_0$ |
| Power    | Probability of detecting a true effect ($1 - \beta$)          |

---

## 📈 Visual Intuition

In a typical test, you have two distributions:

* The distribution assuming $H_0$ is true
* The distribution assuming $H_1$ is true

The overlap between these determines:

* **Type I error region** (tail of $H_0$)
* **Type II error region** (where you fail to reject despite $H_1$ being true)

Would you like a visual or numeric example to walk through a real hypothesis test (e.g., z-test or t-test)?


---

## What is the likelihood ratio test and how is it used?

The **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)** is a powerful and general method in statistical hypothesis testing used to compare **two nested models** — typically:

* A **null hypothesis** $H_0$: simpler (fewer parameters)
* An **alternative hypothesis** $H_1$: more complex (more parameters)

---

## 🔹 Basic Idea

It compares how well each model explains the data using their **maximum likelihoods**. The **likelihood ratio** is:

$$
\Lambda = \frac{L(\hat{\theta}_0)}{L(\hat{\theta}_1)}
$$

Where:

* $L(\hat{\theta}_0)$: Maximum likelihood under $H_0$
* $L(\hat{\theta}_1)$: Maximum likelihood under $H_1$

We usually work with the **log-likelihood ratio**:

$$
-2 \log \Lambda = -2 \left[ \log L(\hat{\theta}_0) - \log L(\hat{\theta}_1) \right]
$$

---

## 🔍 Test Statistic

$$
\boxed{
\lambda = -2 \log \Lambda = 2 \left[ \log L(\hat{\theta}_1) - \log L(\hat{\theta}_0) \right]
}
$$

Under certain regularity conditions, **Wilks' Theorem** says that:

$$
\lambda \xrightarrow{d} \chi^2_k
$$

where:

* $k$ = number of additional parameters in $H_1$ vs $H_0$
* $\chi^2_k$: Chi-squared distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom

---

## ✅ How It’s Used (Steps)

1. **Specify models**:

   * $H_0$: Restricted model (e.g., $\mu = 0$)
   * $H_1$: Full model (e.g., $\mu$ is unknown)

2. **Estimate parameters** under both $H_0$ and $H_1$

3. **Compute likelihoods**:

   * $L(\hat{\theta}_0)$, $L(\hat{\theta}_1)$

4. **Calculate the test statistic**:

   $$
   \lambda = 2 \left[ \log L(\hat{\theta}_1) - \log L(\hat{\theta}_0) \right]
   $$

5. **Compare** $\lambda$ to $\chi^2_k$ critical value or compute the **p-value**

---

## 📌 Example

### Test:

* $H_0: \mu = 0$
* $H_1: \mu \ne 0$

Assume normal data $X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$

1. Under $H_0$, estimate likelihood with $\mu = 0$
2. Under $H_1$, estimate likelihood with $\hat{\mu} = \bar{x}$
3. Plug into likelihood ratio formula
4. Compare $\lambda$ to $\chi^2_1$

---

## 🔦 Advantages of the LRT

* **General framework**: Works for complex models (GLMs, logistic regression, etc.)
* **Powerful**: Optimal under many conditions
* **Asymptotic properties**: Well-understood distribution under $H_0$

## Derive the moment generating function for a normal distribution.

Sure! Let's derive the **moment generating function (MGF)** for a **normal distribution**.

---

## 🔹 Definition of MGF

The **moment generating function** $M_X(t)$ of a random variable $X$ is defined as:

$$
M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}]
$$

For the normal distribution $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we want to compute:

$$
M_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{tx} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dx
$$

---

## 🔹 Step-by-Step Derivation

### Step 1: Combine exponents

Combine the exponential terms:

$$
e^{tx} \cdot e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} = \exp\left( tx - \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$

So the MGF becomes:

$$
M_X(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left( tx - \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) dx
$$

---

### Step 2: Complete the square

We simplify the exponent:

$$
tx - \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}
$$

Let’s expand $(x - \mu)^2$ and combine:

$$
= tx - \frac{x^2 - 2\mu x + \mu^2}{2\sigma^2}
= tx - \frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{\mu x}{\sigma^2} - \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2}
$$

Group terms:

$$
= -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}x^2 + \left(t + \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2}\right)x - \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2}
$$

Now complete the square in $x$. We want to write the quadratic as:

$$
-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left( x - (\mu + \sigma^2 t) \right)^2 + \text{constant}
$$

After completing the square, the exponent simplifies to:

$$
\frac{\sigma^2 t^2}{2} + \mu t - \frac{(x - (\mu + \sigma^2 t))^2}{2\sigma^2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Evaluate the integral

Now the MGF becomes:

$$
M_X(t) = \exp\left(\mu t + \frac{\sigma^2 t^2}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp\left( -\frac{(x - (\mu + \sigma^2 t))^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) dx
$$

The integral is just the integral of a **normal PDF**, centered at $\mu + \sigma^2 t$, so it equals 1.

---

## ✅ Final Result

$$
\boxed{M_X(t) = \exp\left( \mu t + \frac{\sigma^2 t^2}{2} \right)}
$$

This is the **moment generating function of a normal distribution** $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$.

## What is the multivariate normal distribution? How do you check for positive-definiteness of the covariance matrix?


### 📌 What is the **Multivariate Normal Distribution**?

The **multivariate normal distribution** is the generalization of the normal distribution to multiple variables. It's a fundamental distribution in multivariate statistics, modeling jointly Gaussian random variables.

### 🔹 Definition

f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2} |\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|^{1/2}} \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu}) \right)
$$

| Property       | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

### 🔎 Positive-Definiteness of the Covariance Matrix

The **covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$** in a multivariate normal distribution must be:

* **Symmetric**: $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^\top$
* **Positive semi-definite** (PSD): $\mathbf{z}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{z} \ge 0 \ \forall \ \mathbf{z} \ne \mathbf{0}$
* **Positive definite** (PD) for a proper PDF (i.e., invertible): $\mathbf{z}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{z} > 0$

---

### 🧪 How to Check for Positive-Definiteness

Let $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. To check if it’s **positive definite**:

#### ✅ Common Tests:

1. **Eigenvalues**:

   * $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is positive definite ⟺ all eigenvalues $\lambda_i > 0$

2. **Cholesky Decomposition**:

   * Attempt a **Cholesky factorization** $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathbf{L} \mathbf{L}^\top$
   * If this succeeds without error, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is PD

3. **Leading Principal Minors**:

   * All leading principal minors (determinants of top-left $k \times k$ submatrices) are > 0

4. **Quadratic Form**:

   * Test $\mathbf{z}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{z} > 0$ for many nonzero $\mathbf{z}$

---

### ⚠️ Positive Semi-Definite vs. Positive Definite

* **Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)**: Some eigenvalues may be zero

  * OK for degenerate distributions (e.g., singular covariance)
* **Positive Definite (PD)**: All eigenvalues strictly > 0

  * Required for full-rank multivariate normals

## Explain Bayes’ Theorem in the context of prior and posterior distributions.


Bayes’ Theorem is a fundamental result in probability theory and statistics that describes how to **update our beliefs** (probabilities) about a hypothesis or parameter in light of new evidence or data.

In the context of **prior and posterior distributions**, Bayes’ Theorem forms the core of **Bayesian inference**.

---

## 🔹 Bayes’ Theorem (Basic Form)

For events $A$ and $B$ with $P(B) > 0$:

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

* $P(A)$: **Prior** — belief about $A$ before seeing data
* $P(B \mid A)$: **Likelihood** — probability of observing data $B$ if $A$ is true
* $P(B)$: **Evidence** (normalizing constant)
* $P(A \mid B)$: **Posterior** — updated belief about $A$ after observing $B$

---

## 🔹 Bayes’ Theorem (Parameter Form)

In Bayesian statistics, we usually have:

* A parameter $\theta$ (unknown)
* Observed data $x$

Then Bayes’ Theorem becomes:

$$
\boxed{
p(\theta \mid x) = \frac{p(x \mid \theta) \cdot p(\theta)}{p(x)}
}
$$

### Where:

| Term               | Meaning                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $p(\theta)$        | **Prior** — belief about $\theta$ before data                                |
| $p(x \mid \theta)$ | **Likelihood** — model of data given $\theta$                                |
| $p(x)$             | **Evidence** — marginal likelihood: $\int p(x \mid \theta)p(\theta) d\theta$ |
| $p(\theta \mid x)$ | **Posterior** — updated belief about $\theta$ after seeing $x$               |

---

## 🔸 Interpretation

* **Prior**: Encodes what we believe about the parameter before any data.
* **Likelihood**: Measures how well each parameter value explains the observed data.
* **Posterior**: Combines both to give an updated belief distribution over the parameter.

---

## 🧠 Example

Suppose we are estimating the probability $\theta$ of success in a Bernoulli trial (like a coin flip).

* **Prior**: $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$
* **Likelihood**: $x_1, \dots, x_n \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$

Then:

* Posterior is also Beta:

$$
\theta \mid x_1, \dots, x_n \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha + \text{#successes}, \beta + \text{#failures})
$$

This gives us a **distribution** over possible values of $\theta$, not just a point estimate.

---

## 🔍 Why It Matters

* **Uncertainty is quantified**: Posterior is a full distribution, not a single number.
* **Inference is flexible**: You can include prior knowledge, even subjective beliefs.
* **Bayesian updating**: Posterior from one experiment becomes prior for the next.

## What is a conjugate prior? Give examples.


### 📌 What is a **Conjugate Prior**?

In **Bayesian statistics**, a **conjugate prior** is a prior distribution that, when combined with a **likelihood function**, results in a **posterior distribution of the same family** as the prior.

---

### 🔹 Formal Definition

A prior distribution $p(\theta)$ is **conjugate** to a likelihood function $p(x \mid \theta)$ if the posterior $p(\theta \mid x)$ is in the same distributional family as $p(\theta)$.

This simplifies computation and analysis, especially when closed-form solutions are desirable.

---

## ✅ Why Use Conjugate Priors?

* Algebraic **simplicity** and analytical **tractability**
* Easy to **update** beliefs with new data
* Useful for **sequential inference** and **Bayesian filtering**

---

## 🔸 Common Examples of Conjugate Priors

| Likelihood (Data Model)              | Conjugate Prior                  | Posterior Distribution                |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Bernoulli / Binomial**             | Beta($\alpha, \beta$)            | Beta($\alpha + x, \beta + n - x$)     |
| **Poisson(λ)**                       | Gamma($\alpha, \beta$)           | Gamma($\alpha + \sum x_i, \beta + n$) |
| **Normal (mean known, var unknown)** | Inverse-Gamma or Gamma           | Same family                           |
| **Normal (var known)**               | Normal($\mu_0, \tau^2$)          | Normal with updated mean/variance     |
| **Multinomial**                      | Dirichlet($\boldsymbol{\alpha}$) | Dirichlet with updated counts         |
| **Exponential(λ)**                   | Gamma                            | Gamma                                 |

---

### 🧠 Example: Beta-Binomial Model

Let’s say we observe coin flips and want to infer the probability $\theta$ of heads.

* **Likelihood**:
  $x \sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta)$
* **Prior**:
  $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$
* **Posterior**:

  $$
  \theta \mid x \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha + x, \beta + n - x)
  $$

The Beta prior is **conjugate** to the Binomial likelihood, and the posterior is also a Beta distribution.

---

### ⚠️ Non-Conjugate Example

* Suppose you choose a **uniform** prior for $\theta \in [0,1]$, and observe **normal data**.
* The posterior will **not** be a uniform distribution—it’ll be **non-conjugate**, possibly with no closed-form.

---

### 📘 Summary

* A **conjugate prior** stays in the same distributional family after observing data.
* It's a **computational convenience**, not a necessity.
* Widely used in **classical Bayesian models**, although modern Bayesian methods (e.g., MCMC) can handle non-conjugate priors too.




---

## How do MCMC methods like Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling work?

Great question! Let's walk through how **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods — specifically **Metropolis-Hastings** and **Gibbs Sampling** — work, and why they're used in Bayesian inference.

---

## 🔹 What Is MCMC?

**MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)** is a class of algorithms used to **generate samples from a probability distribution** when direct sampling is difficult (e.g. complex or high-dimensional posterior distributions in Bayesian statistics).

The idea is to construct a **Markov chain** whose stationary distribution is the **target distribution** (e.g., the posterior), and to **simulate** that chain to get samples.

---

## 🔸 1. Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

### 📌 Goal:

Generate samples from a distribution $\pi(\theta)$, e.g., a posterior $p(\theta \mid x)$, that we **can evaluate up to a constant**.

---

### ⚙️ Steps:

1. **Initialize** $\theta^{(0)}$
2. For $t = 1$ to $T$:

   * Propose a new state $\theta^* \sim q(\theta^* \mid \theta^{(t-1)})$ from a **proposal distribution**
   * Compute the **acceptance ratio**:

     $$
     r = \frac{\pi(\theta^*) q(\theta^{(t-1)} \mid \theta^*)}{\pi(\theta^{(t-1)}) q(\theta^* \mid \theta^{(t-1)})}
     $$
   * Accept $\theta^*$ with probability $\min(1, r)$; otherwise, stay at $\theta^{(t-1)}$

---

### 🔁 Key Notes:

* If the proposal is **symmetric**, e.g. $q(a \mid b) = q(b \mid a)$, then:

  $$
  r = \frac{\pi(\theta^*)}{\pi(\theta^{(t-1)})}
  $$
* Over time, the samples $\theta^{(t)}$ approximate the target distribution $\pi(\theta)$
* Requires tuning of the proposal distribution $q$

---

## 🔸 2. Gibbs Sampling

Gibbs Sampling is a **special case** of Metropolis-Hastings for **multivariate distributions** where each **conditional distribution** is known and easy to sample from.

---

### 📌 Goal:

Sample from $p(\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n)$

---

### ⚙️ Steps:

1. Initialize $\theta_1^{(0)}, \theta_2^{(0)}, \dots, \theta_n^{(0)}$
2. For each iteration $t = 1$ to $T$:

   * Sample each variable from its **full conditional distribution**, given the current values of the others:

     $$
     \theta_1^{(t)} \sim p(\theta_1 \mid \theta_2^{(t-1)}, \theta_3^{(t-1)}, \ldots)
     $$

     $$
     \theta_2^{(t)} \sim p(\theta_2 \mid \theta_1^{(t)}, \theta_3^{(t-1)}, \ldots)
     $$

     ...

     $$
     \theta_n^{(t)} \sim p(\theta_n \mid \theta_1^{(t)}, \theta_2^{(t)}, \ldots)
     $$

---

### 🧠 Intuition:

Each step **updates one variable** by sampling from its conditional distribution while keeping others fixed. After many iterations, the full vector $(\theta_1^{(t)}, \ldots, \theta_n^{(t)})$ approximates the joint posterior.

---

## ✅ Summary: MCMC Methods

| Feature             | Metropolis-Hastings             | Gibbs Sampling                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Proposals**       | Arbitrary proposal distribution | Conditionals from full joint            |
| **Acceptance step** | Yes (may reject)                | No (always accept)                      |
| **Sampling from**   | Any distribution (unnormalized) | Must be able to sample each conditional |
| **Flexibility**     | Very flexible                   | Efficient if conditionals are tractable |

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Suppose we have a Bayesian model:

* Data $x$
* Parameters $\theta = (\mu, \sigma^2)$
* Posterior $p(\mu, \sigma^2 \mid x)$ is complex

If we can compute:

* $p(\mu \mid \sigma^2, x)$
* $p(\sigma^2 \mid \mu, x)$

Then **Gibbs sampling** is ideal.

If not, and only the joint $p(\mu, \sigma^2 \mid x)$ is known up to a constant, use **Metropolis-Hastings**.



---


##  Given a biased coin, how do you estimate the bias from a sample? How would the **confidence interval** change with sample size?

To estimate the **bias** of a biased coin (i.e., the probability $p$ of getting heads), you use **frequentist estimation** methods from statistics. Here’s how it works:

---

### 🧮 Estimating the Bias from a Sample

Let’s say you flip the coin $n$ times, and you observe $h$ heads. The **maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)** of the probability $p$ of heads is:

$$
\hat{p} = \frac{h}{n}
$$

This is your best estimate of the coin's bias based on the observed sample.

---

### 📏 Confidence Interval for the Bias

A **confidence interval (CI)** gives a range that likely contains the true bias $p$. For a binomial proportion like this, a common way to construct a CI is using the **normal approximation** to the binomial distribution (appropriate when $n$ is large and $p$ not too close to 0 or 1).

#### **Wald Confidence Interval (simple, but can be inaccurate near 0 or 1):**

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n} }
$$

* $\hat{p}$ = sample proportion of heads
* $z_{\alpha/2}$ = critical value from the standard normal distribution (e.g., 1.96 for 95% CI)
* $n$ = number of coin tosses

---

### 📉 Effect of Sample Size on Confidence Interval

As **sample size $n$ increases**:

* The standard error $\sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n} }$ **decreases**
* The confidence interval becomes **narrower**, meaning we can estimate $p$ more precisely.

#### Example:

| Sample Size $n$ | $\hat{p} = 0.6$ | 95% CI Width |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 10              | 0.6 ± 0.308     | 0.616        |
| 100             | 0.6 ± 0.098     | 0.196        |
| 1000            | 0.6 ± 0.031     | 0.062        |

So, **larger sample → smaller confidence interval → more certainty** in the estimate of $p$.

---

### 🔍 Better CIs

Other methods like the **Wilson score interval** or **Jeffreys interval** are more accurate than the Wald interval, especially for small samples or extreme $\hat{p}$ values. Let me know if you’d like an example using those!

## Suppose $X \sim N(0,1)$, what is $P(X^2 > 4)$? How would you generalize this to Chi-squared?

Great question! Let's go step by step.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Given:

$$
X \sim N(0, 1)
$$

We are asked to compute:

$$
P(X^2 > 4)
$$

---

## 🧮 Step 1: Recognize the Distribution

If $X \sim N(0,1)$, then:

$$
X^2 \sim \chi^2(1)
$$

This is a **Chi-squared distribution** with 1 degree of freedom (dof).

So the probability becomes:

$$
P(X^2 > 4) = P(\chi^2(1) > 4)
$$

---

## 🔢 Step 2: Compute the Probability

To compute $P(\chi^2(1) > 4)$, you can either:

### Option A: Use standard normal

Since $X \sim N(0,1)$:

$$
P(X^2 > 4) = P(|X| > 2) = P(X > 2) + P(X < -2)
$$

Due to symmetry of the standard normal:

$$
P(|X| > 2) = 2P(X > 2)
$$

From standard normal tables:

$$
P(X > 2) \approx 0.0228
$$

So:

$$
P(X^2 > 4) = 2 \cdot 0.0228 = \boxed{0.0456}
$$

---

### Option B: Use Chi-squared table or software

$$
P(\chi^2(1) > 4) \approx 0.0455
$$

Same result, just a different path.

---

## 🔁 Generalization to Chi-squared

If $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k \sim N(0,1)$ are independent, then:

$$
Y = \sum_{i=1}^k X_i^2 \sim \chi^2(k)
$$

So in general:

$$
P\left( \sum_{i=1}^k X_i^2 > c \right) = P(\chi^2(k) > c)
$$

You can compute this using:

* Chi-squared tables
* Python's `scipy.stats.chi2.sf(c, k)`
* R's `pchisq(c, df = k, lower.tail = FALSE)`

---

## ✅ Summary

* $P(X^2 > 4) = P(\chi^2(1) > 4) \approx \boxed{0.0455}$
* Generalizes to $\chi^2(k)$ if summing squares of $k$ standard normals

## Given two independent normal variables, what is the distribution of their sum and ratio?


This is a classic and important question in probability theory. Let's go through it step-by-step:

---

## ✅ Given:

Let $X \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2)$ and $Y \sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)$, and assume **independence**: $X \perp Y$.

We want to find the distribution of:

1. $X + Y$
2. $\frac{X}{Y}$

---

## 🧮 1. Distribution of the **Sum** $Z = X + Y$

The **sum of two independent normal variables is also normal**, with:

* Mean: $\mu_Z = \mu_X + \mu_Y$
* Variance: $\sigma_Z^2 = \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2$

So:

$$
X + Y \sim N(\mu_X + \mu_Y, \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2)
$$

> ✅ The normal distribution is **closed under addition** (and subtraction) when variables are independent.

---

## 🌀 2. Distribution of the **Ratio** $R = \frac{X}{Y}$

This is **not** normally distributed. The distribution depends on the parameters of $X$ and $Y$, and the ratio generally has **heavy tails**. Here are key special cases:

---

### 📌 Special Case: $X \sim N(0, 1), Y \sim N(0, 1)$

Then:

$$
R = \frac{X}{Y} \sim \text{Cauchy}(0, 1)
$$

This is a **standard Cauchy distribution** — a heavy-tailed distribution without a defined mean or variance.

---

### 📌 General Case: $X \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2), Y \sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)$

In general, the ratio $R = \frac{X}{Y}$ does **not follow a named distribution** except in special cases. But it's known as a **ratio of independent normal variables**, and its PDF can be expressed as:

$$
f_R(r) = \frac{1}{\pi} \cdot \frac{a}{(r - b)^2 + a^2}
$$

in the special case where it reduces to a **Cauchy**, or in general as a more complex expression involving modified Bessel functions.

You **cannot** express this ratio as another standard distribution (like normal or chi-squared), unless one variable is constant or both have special structure (e.g., mean 0, same variance).

---

## ✅ Summary

| Operation     | Distribution                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $X + Y$       | $\mathcal{N}(\mu_X + \mu_Y,\ \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2)$                   |
| $\frac{X}{Y}$ | Ratio of normals (in general); **Cauchy** if both \~ $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ |

Let me know if you want the exact formula for the general ratio's PDF or a code simulation!

Let's go through each of your questions in order:

---

### **1. What is the difference between MLE and MAP estimation?**

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** and **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)** are both methods for estimating parameters of a statistical model, but they differ in how they treat prior information.

| Aspect                        | MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation)                                                                               | MAP (Maximum A Posteriori)                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**                      | Find the parameter $\theta$ that **maximizes the likelihood**:  $\theta_{MLE} = \arg\max_\theta P(D \mid \theta)$ | Find the parameter $\theta$ that **maximizes the posterior**: $\theta_{MAP} = \arg\max_\theta P(\theta \mid D) $ |
| **Incorporates Prior?**       | ❌ No — only uses data                                                                                             | ✅ Yes — uses prior belief $P(\theta)$                                                                            |
| **Formula (via Bayes' Rule)** | $\theta_{MLE} = \arg\max_\theta P(D \mid \theta)$                                                                 | $\theta_{MAP} = \arg\max_\theta P(D \mid \theta)P(\theta)$                                                       |
| **When are they the same?**   | If the prior $P(\theta)$ is uniform (non-informative), MAP = MLE                                                  | —                                                                                                                |

---

### **2. Derive the MLE for the rate $\lambda$ of a Poisson process**

Suppose you observe $n$ i.i.d. samples $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ from a Poisson distribution with unknown rate parameter $\lambda$. Each $x_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$, so:

$$
P(x_i \mid \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_i}}{x_i!}
$$

**Likelihood function:**

$$
L(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_i}}{x_i!} = e^{-n\lambda} \lambda^{\sum x_i} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i!}
$$

**Log-likelihood:**

$$
\log L(\lambda) = -n\lambda + \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) \log \lambda - \sum_{i=1}^n \log(x_i!)
$$

To find the MLE, take the derivative w\.r.t. $\lambda$ and set it to zero:

$$
\frac{d}{d\lambda} \log L(\lambda) = -n + \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0
$$

Solve for $\lambda$:

$$
\lambda_{MLE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \bar{x}
$$

✅ **MLE for Poisson rate $\lambda$ is the sample mean**.

---

### **3. How would you test if two samples come from the same distribution?**

This is a **two-sample hypothesis test**. There are several options depending on what assumptions you can make:

#### **Parametric Tests** (assumes known distribution form):

* **t-test** (for normal distributions, tests means):

  * Null Hypothesis: The two samples have the same mean.
  * Use if both samples are approximately normal and variances are equal.
* **F-test** (tests equality of variances)

#### **Non-parametric Tests** (no distributional assumptions):

* **Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test**:

  * Tests whether two samples come from the same continuous distribution.
* **Mann–Whitney U test**:

  * Tests whether one distribution tends to yield larger values than the other.
* **Anderson–Darling test**:

  * More sensitive to differences in tails than KS.

#### **Machine Learning-based**:

* **Classifier two-sample test**:

  * Train a classifier to distinguish between the two samples. If accuracy is significantly better than chance, reject the null.

✅ **Recommended approach**: Use **KS test** if you don’t want to assume anything about the distributions.
