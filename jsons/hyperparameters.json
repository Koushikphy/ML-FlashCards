    "question": "<p>Hyperparameters</p>\n",
    "answer": "<p>Hyperparameters are parameters that <strong>are set prior to the training of a machine learning model</strong>. Unlike model parameters, which are learned during training (e.g., weights in a neural network), hyperparameters are chosen by the data scientist or machine learning engineer based on prior knowledge, experience, or through experimentation. Hereâ€™s a concise explanation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Definition</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperparameters are configuration variables that determine the behavior and performance of a model.</li>\n<li>They are not directly learned from the data but are set before training begins.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Examples</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learning Rate</strong>: Controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.</li>\n<li><strong>Number of Trees (in Random Forest)</strong>: Determines the number of decision trees to be used in the ensemble.</li>\n<li><strong>Regularization Parameters</strong>: Control the complexity of models, such as the penalty in ridge and lasso regression.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Parameters (in SVM)</strong>: Define the type of kernel function used and its specific parameters.</li>\n<li><strong>Depth of Decision Trees</strong>: Limits the maximum depth of decision trees in tree-based models like decision trees and random forests.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Importance</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Proper selection of hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance, convergence speed, and ability to generalize to new data.</li>\n<li>Poor choices of hyperparameters can lead to overfitting or underfitting of the model.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n",
