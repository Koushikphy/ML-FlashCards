    "question": "<p>What is Linear Regression</p>",
    "answer": "<p>Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The goal is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is commonly used for prediction, trend analysis, and forecasting. </p>",
