    "answer": "<p><strong>Bayesian inference</strong> is a statistical method based on <strong>Bayes' Theorem</strong>, which provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or data becomes available. It is a cornerstone of probabilistic reasoning and is widely used in machine learning, data science, and statistics.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Bayes' Theorem Formula</strong></h4>\n\n<p>$$P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H) \\cdot P(H)}{P(E)},$$</p>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$P(H|E)$: <strong>Posterior probability</strong>. The probability of the hypothesis $H$ given the evidence $E$.</li>\n<li>$P(H)$: <strong>Prior probability</strong>. The initial probability of the hypothesis before observing any evidence.</li>\n<li>$P(E|H)$: <strong>Likelihood</strong>. The probability of observing the evidence $E$ given the hypothesis $H$ is true.</li>\n<li>$P(E)$: <strong>Marginal likelihood</strong> or evidence. The total probability of observing the evidence under all possible hypotheses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4><strong>How It Works</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Bayesian inference adjusts the <strong>prior belief</strong> $P(H)$ based on new evidence $E$ to compute the <strong>posterior belief</strong> $P(H|E)$. It allows us to make predictions or decisions in the presence of uncertainty.</p>\n",
