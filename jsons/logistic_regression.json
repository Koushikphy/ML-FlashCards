    "question": "<p>What is Logistic Regression</p>\n",
    "answer": "<p>Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of one of two possible outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false). The output is a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of belonging to a certain class. Despite its name, it is a classification algorithm, not a regression one.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>How It Works</strong></h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Linear Model</strong>: Logistic regression starts with a linear equation:\n$$z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\dots + w_nx_n + b$$\nwhere $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ are the input features, $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$ are the weights, and $b$ is the bias.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Sigmoid Function</strong>: The linear output ($z$) is passed through a <strong>sigmoid function</strong> to map it into a probability range $[0, 1]$:\n$$P(y=1|x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$\nThe result is interpreted as the probability of the positive class ($y=1$).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Decision Boundary</strong>: A threshold (commonly 0.5) is applied to classify the output:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If $P(y=1|x) &gt; 0.5$, classify as $y=1$.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, classify as $y=0$.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><strong>Objective Function</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Logistic regression minimizes the <strong>log-loss</strong> (also called binary cross-entropy):\n$$J(w, b) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ y_i \\log(h(x_i)) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - h(x_i)) \\right]$$\nwhere $h(x_i)$ is the predicted probability, $y_i$ is the actual label, and $m$ is the number of samples.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Key Features</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Linear Decision Boundary</strong>: Logistic regression is a linear classifier, so it works well when the classes are linearly separable.</li>\n<li><strong>Probabilistic Output</strong>: Provides probabilities, not just classifications, making it interpretable for applications like medical diagnostics.</li>\n</ul>\n",
