    "question": "<p>What is Logistic Regression</p>",
    "answer": "<p>Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an outcome that can be one of two possible categories (e.g., yes/no, true/false, 0/1) by applying a logistic function (sigmoid) to a linear combination of input features. The output is a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of belonging to a certain class. Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification, not regression.</p>",
