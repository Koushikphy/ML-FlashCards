    "question": "<p>K-Nearest Neighbors</p>\n",
    "answer": "<p>K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a <strong>supervised learning algorithm</strong> used for <strong>classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong>. It is simple and intuitive, relying on the proximity of data points to make predictions. KNN works on the principle of similarity. It classifies or predicts a data point's target value based on how its nearest neighbors are classified or predicted. Its </p>\n\n<h3>K-NN Algorithm</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For Classification</strong>: Calculates the distance between the new data point and all points in the training set (e.g., usually Euclidean distance).Then, identify the ( K )-nearest neighbors to the new point and assign the majority class among these neighbors to the new point.</li>\n<li><strong>For Regression</strong>: Predicts the average (mean or median) value of the target variable among the ( K )-nearest neighbors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lazy Learner</strong>: No model is built during the training phase; the entire dataset is stored for prediction.</li>\n<li><strong>Distance Metric</strong>: Common choices for measuring distance include: Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance, Cosine Similarity (for text or high-dimensional data).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and easy to implement.</li>\n<li>No assumptions about the data distribution.</li>\n<li>Works well with small datasets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Disadvantages</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Computationally Expensive</strong>: Requires calculating distances for all training points during prediction.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensitive to Noise</strong>: Outliers can affect predictions, especially with small ( K ).</li>\n<li><strong>Curse of Dimensionality</strong>: Performance degrades in high-dimensional spaces where distances become less meaningful.</li>\n<li>Requires careful scaling of features, as larger-scale features dominate distance calculations.</li>\n</ul>\n",
